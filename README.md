# RCTab Function Apps

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/rctab-functions/badge/?version=latest)](https://rctab-functions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

These are the Azure function apps for RCTab.
You can find the full RCTab docs [here](https://rctab.readthedocs.io/), the online function app documentation [here](https://rctab-cli.readthedocs.io/) and the documentation source code in [docs/](docs/).

In addition, each of the three functions has its own README:

1. [usage_function](./usage_function/) collects data on how much each subscription has spent
1. [status_function](./status_function/) collects data on how much each subscription has spent
1. [controller_function](./controller_function/) turns subscriptions on/off according to their expiry data and remaining budget
